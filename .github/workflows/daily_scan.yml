        # Note: In a real cloud setup, you need to persist the DB (e.g., using S3 or a managed DB).
        # For GitHub Actions (Ephemeral), this will start fresh each time unless we use artifacts/cache.
        # But for "Alert Scanning", a fresh DB + Fetching is fine (it fetches history).
        # We lose "Active Trades" tracking in ephemeral runs. 
        # Recommendation: Use Streamlit Cloud for persistence or a proper DB.
